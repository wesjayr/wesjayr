### Hello, I'm Wesley 👨🏾‍💻 🤟🏾

I'm a systems analyst with a background in Java that is passionate about technology and leading through servanthood. Some of my other exciting roles center around data architecture and data modeling with some scrum master duties bundled in there. Software development has been my passion and I'm utilizing this as an opportunity to reignite that fire. 🔥
